1.What is os? 
- interface b/w user and hardware.

2.What is Cloud Computing? 
- It  is on-demand delivery of IT resources over the network. We can access technical resources such as storage, database, compute, networking, security with
  pay as you go.

3.Cloud providers in market.
- AWS
- microsoft Azure
- GCP(Google Cloud Platform)

4.What is SDLC.
- Software Development Life Cycle. It is a structured step by step process that development teams used to create high quality, effective and secure software.

5.What is server components.
- OS(linux/win/mac)
- RAM(6/8/12/16 etc GB)
- ROM(HDD/SSD)
- Networking

- ls(enter) -> touch shama -> ls -> cat > shama(write anything, to close file - cntrl c) -> cat shama -> rm shama -> clear -> mkdir lopes -> ls -> cd lopes -> touch f1
  -> cat > f1 -> cat f1 -> cd ..(to come out of the directory) -> ls -> mkdir mangalore -> ls -> rmdir lopes(directory not empty) -> rm -r lopes -> rmdir mangalore -> 
  ls -> clear -> ls -l -> ls -> pwd -> mkdir shiva -> cd shiva -> pwd -> mkdir lopes -> cd lopes -> pwd -> cd ../..
- ls is a command to list files and directories
- touch a command to create empty files.
- rm is command to remove a file.
- rm -r is command to delete directory with files.
- rmdir is a command to delete empty directory.
- mkdir is a command to create a directory.
- cd: change directory.
- ls -l: list the files and directories with permissions.
- pwd: print working directory/present
- history: to see previously executed commands.

7.DevOps
- DevOps is a set of practices, principles and cultural philosopies that aim to bridge the gap b/w software development and operations.
- The goal of DevOps is to shorten the software development life cycle, improve collaboration b/w development and operations team and deliver high quality software
  faster and more efficiently.
- DevOps is not a Technology, It's a Methodology.
- DevOps is imprtant because its a software development and operations approach that enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing
  deployments.
- Key elements: automation, continuous integration, automation, continuous delivery, collaboration and communication, monitoring.
- Watefall Model: it has distinct goals for each phase of development.
  *Requirements
  *Analysis
  *Design
  *Coding
  *Testing
  *Operation
- Limitation: Once  application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change something that was not weel-thought out in the concept stage.
- Benefits: Speed, Rapid Delivery, Reliability, Improved Collaboration, Scale, Security.
- DevOps Work:               Plan                                 Release
                             Code                                 Deploy
                             Build                                Operate
                             Test                                 Monitor
8.Agile Methodology
- DevOps is a culture, fosytering collaboration among all participants involved in the development and maintenance of software. Agile can be described as a development
  methodology designed to maintain productivity and drive releases with the common reality of changing needs.

9.EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud

10.What is a Server?
 - Server is a powerful computer, a system that provides services or data to other computers not as clients.
 - servers are designed to manage, store and process data and they play a critical role in handeling requests delivering responses within a network.
 - Tyes of Servers:
   *Web Server: delivers webpages to users browsers, ex: nginX
   *File Server: stores and manages files that clients can access and share over a network.
   *Database Server: manage Database and provide access to clients for reading, writing and updating data. ex: mySQL, MongoDB.
   *Mail Server: handles sending, receiving and storage of emails. ex: microsoft exchange.
   
   Clients --------> |Internet| ---------> Server

- server Components: OS, RAM, CPU, storage, NIC, ROM.
- EC2 Configuration Steps: 
  1.name of the server
  2.application and os images(Amazon Machine Image)
  3.Instance Type: choose number of CPU's and RAM.
  4.Keypair: used to connect securely to instance.
  5.Networking:
          -firewalls
          -VPC: Virtual Private Cloud
          -Subnets
